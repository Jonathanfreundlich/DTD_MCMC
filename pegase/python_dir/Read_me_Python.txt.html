Pégase.3.0.1a: Python files for reading the outputs of Pégase.3.0.1

================================================================================

To extract the code from the compressed archive, move to the directory 
above "Pegase.3.0.1/" and type 
        "tar xvf Pegase.3.0.1a.tar.gz"
in a terminal. This creates in "./Pegase.3.0.1/" a directory called 
"Python_dir/" which contains all the Python files for reading the outputs
of the code.

"plot_spectra.py", "plot_grain_temp.py" and "plot_grain_SED.py" are the 
Python analogs of the Fortran files "plot_spectra.f90", "plot_grain_temp.f90"
and "plot_grain_SED.90". To run any of them, "plot_spectra.py" for instance, 
move to "Python_dir/", type
        "python plot_spectra.py"
and answer the questions. If needed, change the path to the root and home 
directories in "mod_directories.py".
